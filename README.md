# Reproduce Medical-Record-Linkage-Ensemble

This repository contains the full code to reproduce results of the paper "Statistical supervised meta-ensemble algorithm for data linkage".

+ All of the code in this repository used Python 3.6 or higher with these prerequisite packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `recordlinkage`. To install a missing package, use command `pip install package-name` in a terminal (i.e., cmd in Windows, or Terminal in MacOS).

1. The cleaned datasets for Scheme A are stored in two files `febrl3_UNSW.csv` and `febrl4_UNSW.csv`.

2. The cleaned datasets for Scheme B are XXXXXXXX

3. Reproduce results for Scheme A by running `MyCodeSchemeA.py`.

4. Reproduce results for Scheme B by running `XXXXXXXXX`.
